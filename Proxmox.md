# Proxmox
## Networking
I don't know much about networking but think Proxmox is a convenient way to learn some things.
For now I would be interested in:
* How do to send data between different subnets?
* How to use a Wireguard LXC as a VPN?
* How to specify which LXC should send data through the VPN?
* How to setup the client LXC to use the VPN connection only?
* How to setup the client LXC to split connections VPN/normal?
### VPN tunnel
Some link's I found online on how to get started.
