# projects-ideas
This is a collection of my project ideas - ideas that most likely won't be done, but at least I can turn off the reminders to write them down TT

## PWM library with hardware tests
Raspberry PI checking actual HW PWM from microcontroller
- Lizard for checking
- Unit tests
  - Catch22
  - googletest
    
## Pomodoro LED matrix timer
Build hardware for an LED matrix pomodoro timer.
I never used an esp32 before so that might be something to use.
I have an LED matrix already, even though it is a relatively big one. I can always reuse it.
Alternatively, I like to use a Raspberry PI Z, but they are hard to come by recently (Feb 2023).
