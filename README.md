# project-ideas
This is a collection of my project ideas - ideas that most likely won't be done, but at least I can turn off the reminders to write them down TT

## PWM library with hardware tests
Raspberry PI checking actual HW PWM from microcontroller
- Lizard for checking
- Unit tests
  - Catch22
  - googletest
    
## Pomodoro LED matrix timer
Build hardware for an LED matrix pomodoro timer.
I never used an esp32 before so that might be something to use.
I have an LED matrix already, even though it is a relatively big one. I can always reuse it.
Alternatively, I like to use a Raspberry PI Z, but they are hard to come by recently (Feb 2023).

## Medical School selector
It is laborious to check all med-schools in canada for there requirements to apply, but there is a overview [table](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CZ1vtqkw8ovNixAWAqYzEGyHoJLNEa3Zbi6s8CYiVGc/edit#gid=0). It would be nice to have a website with selectors that could gibe you the best choices. Additionally, it would be good to add last years admission rate criteria (age, gpa, mcat, etc.), so people can check there chances. Maybe even add cost?
